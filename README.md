# Online Kernel Learning for Active Sensor Networks

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing online kernel learning techniques for active sensor networks. The goal is to enable efficient learning and adaptation in dynamic environments where data is collected through a network of sensors. The implementation is provided in a Jupyter Notebook named `Online_Kernel_Learning_for_Active_Sensor_Network.ipynb`.

## Features
- **Online Learning**: Implements kernel-based online learning algorithms for real-time data processing.
- **Sensor Network Simulation**: Simulates an active sensor network for data collection and analysis.
- **Adaptive Models**: Adapts to dynamic changes in the sensor network environment.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Provides metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the learning algorithm.

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (install via `requirements.txt`):
  ```
  numpy
  scipy
  matplotlib
  scikit-learn
  ```

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Online_Kernel_Learning_for_Active_Sensor_Network.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Online_Kernel_Learning_for_Active_Sensor_Network
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open the `Online_Kernel_Learning_for_Active_Sensor_Network.ipynb` file.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to:
   - Simulate a sensor network.
   - Apply online kernel learning algorithms.
   - Visualize and evaluate results.

## How It Works
1. **Sensor Network Simulation**: A virtual sensor network is created, where each sensor collects data over time.
2. **Kernel-Based Learning**: Online kernel methods are applied to model the relationships between sensor data and adapt to new information.
3. **Real-Time Updates**: The model updates itself dynamically as new data becomes available, ensuring it remains relevant in changing environments.

## Example
- **Input**: Sensor data stream from a dynamic environment.
- **Output**: A trained model that predicts or classifies based on the sensor data, adapting to changes in real-time.

## Customization
You can modify the notebook to:
- Use different kernel functions (e.g., Gaussian, Polynomial).
- Integrate with real-world sensor data.
- Extend to multi-task learning scenarios.
